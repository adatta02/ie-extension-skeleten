=====================

This is a skeleton for a Browser Help Object (Internet Explorer Extension) written in C#.

It is based entirely off http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/19971/How-to-attach-to-Browser-Helper-Object-BHO-with-C

Except, instead of stealing your passwords it loads and executes an external Javascript file.
